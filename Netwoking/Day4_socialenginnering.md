# Social Engineering

- **Social engineering** is the act of manipulating people into performing actions or divulging confidential information.
- It applies to trickery or deception for the purpose of information gathering or computer system access; in most cases the attacker never comes face-to-face with the victim
- It uses psychological manipulation to trick users into making security mistakes or giving away sensitive information.
- The purpose of social engineering is usually to secretly install spyware, other malicious software or to trick persons into handing over passwords or other sensitive financial or personal information.

## Social Engineering Attack Lifecycle/Phase

- The Social Engineering Attack Lifecycle consists of several key phases through which an attacker manipulates a target to achieve their malicious goal.

1. **Research/Investigation Phase**
    - Collecting information about the target to identify potential vulnerabilities, weak points, or ways to exploit human behaviors.
2. **Hook Phase**
    - Establishing contact and building trust with the target, often under a false pretext.
3. **Play Phase**
    - Exploiting the trust gained during the hook phase to carry out the malicious act, such as stealing information, planting malware, or gaining unauthorized access.
4. **Exit Phase**
    - Concluding the attack while covering the attacker's tracks to avoid detection and allow for potential future exploitation.

### Types of Social Engineering

- Based on how we do the social engineering attack, it is classified into many kinds.
    1. Phishing
    2. Vishing
    3. Shoulder Surfing 
    4. Dumpster Diving

    6. Baiting
    7. Scareware
    8. Eavesdropping

4. Dumpster Diving

- Is a technique for getting data is a dumpsters or recycle bins.
- Old companies work was with papers, so when they finish with these papers whey will through them to the dumpster/basket.
- If hacker got that dumpster, and if those papers have some secret information, or company workers name with the Job they intended to do, it will make the attack wider.

### Common pretexting attacks examples

    1. Romance Scam

    - A romance scam is a type of social engineering attack that manipulates feelings like love.
    - Typically, the elderly are victims of such scams.
    - A scammer may pretend to be an online love interest in such a pretexting scam, taking weeks if not months to win the target’s confidence.
    - Ultimately,they may ask for a large loan for an emergency, plane ticket, or a gift.

    2. Grandparent Scam

    - In the grandparent scam, a threat actor will take time to gather intelligence on their target and their relatives. 
    - They may examine the target’s friends list on Facebook and look at the profiles commenting on public photos. 
    - Finally, they will create a fake profile with stolen information and media and approach a grandparent while pretending to be their grandchild, asking for money.
    - The pretext may be trouble at school, a car accident, or some other type of emergency. Usually, the grandparent is sworn into secrecy so the scam can be repeated later until the victim or their family catches on.

    4. Whaling attack

    - Such hackers either pretend to be company leaders to target employees or directly target high-level players(CEO) in an organization.
    - Here, they may gain secret information or a sizable financial payment by using the pretext of a business deal.

    5. Impersonation

    - Impersonation attacks are similar to whaling attacks, but the impersonator will pretend to be a friend, colleague, or unmet contractor rather than a high-level executive to avoid drawing attention. 
    - The hacker will use friendship as a pretext to gain access to company information, servers, and drop malware like ransomware or spyware.
    - Neither the company nor the employee will realize there’s been a breach until too late.

6. Baiting

- Baiting attacks use a false promise to pique a victim’s greed or curiosity. 
- They lure users into a trap that steals their personal information or inflicts their systems with malware.
- Offering something enticing (e.g., free downloads) to trick the victim into providing information or installing malware.
- The most reviled form of baiting uses physical media to disperse malware.

7. Scareware

- Scareware involves victims being bombarded with false alarms and fictitious threats. 
- Users are deceived to think their system is infected with malware, prompting them to install software that has no real benefit (other than for the perpetrator) or is malware itself. 
- Scareware is also referred to as deception software, rogue scanner software and fraudware.

8. Tailgating/Piggybacking

- **Tailgating** is one of the simplest forms of a social engineering attack. 
- It is an easy way for an unauthorized party to get around security mechanisms that are assumed to be secure. 
- The security comes into question due to a combination of human carelessness.
- For example, a retina scanner is meant to limit entry to a physical area by scanning the retinas of authorized personnel. if an employee holds the door for an unknown person behind them out of a misguided sense of courtesy or habit.

9. Eavesdropping

- Eavesdropping, in the context of social engineering, refers to the act of secretly listening in on conversations to gain sensitive information. 
- eavesdropping typically involves intercepting physical or verbal communication, either in person or through devices like mobile phones, to gather intelligence.

#### Example of attack scenario

1. Research Phase:
    - The attacker gathers information on an employee from LinkedIn and other social media platforms, discovering they work in the finance department and often deal with invoices.
2. Hook Phase:
    - The attacker sends a spear-phishing email to the employee, posing as a vendor and requesting payment for a fake invoice.
3. Play Phase:
    - The employee opens the email, clicks the link to download the invoice, which installs malware on their computer, giving the attacker access to the company’s financial systems.
4. Exit Phase:
    - The attacker erases traces of the malware installation, ensuring they can continue to access the compromised systems without detection in the future.

#### prevention ways

##### How do we hack other website 

- Websites like telegram, they don't use username and password, they use phone number as login. So what do we do….
